/**
 * The card's three-stop glass sweep. Every translucent layer costs a full blend pass over the
 * card, so the fill is one gradient rather than a stack of washes.
 *
 * These three alphas (and the border stops below) are the same values Manager's
 * `AppCardLayout` uses — Manager is the source of truth for a card's resolved color, and
 * unlike this file used to, nothing here should modify a color once it's resolved. Manager has
 * no hover concept at all (touch input only); its own interaction source in `HomeAppCardLayout`
 * drives a *press-scale* animation, never a color change. A hover-driven lightness lift lived
 * here for a while and had no Manager counterpart — see git history — which is exactly why it
 * could drift into "the card visibly changes color under the mouse" without that ever being a
 * deliberate design decision on either platform. Removed rather than fixed: there's nothing to
 * bring back into parity, because parity means this gradient is a pure function of the
 * resolved palette, full stop.
