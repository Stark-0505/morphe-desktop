 *
 * Matches by *saved patch identity* (name — see [CopiedSelection]) throughout, never by list
 * position — a candidate whose bundle has since renamed or dropped a patch simply scores
 * lower / offers less, rather than the copy landing on the wrong row.
 *
 * @param targetPatchNames The current target bundle's patch **names** (`Patch.name`, not
 *   `Patch.uniqueId`) — what [PatchPreferencesRepository] actually keys saved selections by.
 * @param displayNameFor Resolves a package name to what the UI should show for it (app label
 *   if known, else the package name itself). Desktop has no single always-available app-data
 *   resolver the way Manager does (Manager reads it from the installed-package cache); callers
 *   pass whatever they already have — [app.morphe.gui.data.repository.PatchSourceManager]'s
 *   callers typically already have this from the supported-apps list.
