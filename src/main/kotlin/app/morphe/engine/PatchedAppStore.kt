/**
 * Persistent store for [PatchedAppRecord]s — the patched-app history shared by
 * the CLI and GUI (see `patched-app-recall-plan.md`).
 *
 * Lives in the engine layer (not GUI) so **both** pipelines can record into one
 * file: `morphe-data/patched-apps.json`. Reads are cached in memory; writes go
 * through a [Mutex] (in-process safety) and are atomic (temp file + move) so a
 * crash mid-write can't corrupt the history.
 *
 * Records are keyed by [PatchedAppRecord.trackingKey], not by package name, so
 * several builds of one app — the app's own install and any copies of it — can
 * be tracked side by side instead of overwriting each other.
 *
 * Writes have a hard success/failure contract: [upsert] and [delete] throw
 * [IOException] when the change could not be persisted, leaving the in-memory
 * state and [changes] untouched. A return therefore always means "on disk".
 *
 * The [file] is injectable for testing; production code uses the default under
 * [MorpheData.root].
